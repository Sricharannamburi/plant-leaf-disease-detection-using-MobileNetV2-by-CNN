<h1>Plant leaf disease detection using MobileNetV2 by CNN</h1>
<p>Plant leaf disease identification is critical since it affects the development of damaged plants as
well as guaranteeing healthy crop output and avoiding economic losses in the agriculture
business. Because agriculture provides food for all humans, but due to the rapid increase in
population, the demand for agriculture is increasing day by day, it is critical to detect plant
disease at an early stage.</p>

<p>In this project, we suggested a Convolutional Neural Network model based on the MobileNetV2
architecture for detecting disease in plant leaves. Because of their ability to learn and extract
relevant characteristics from images, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become a
prominent technique for automated plant disease identification in recent years.<br>
  
  <p>The method
entails preprocessing the leaf images before training and validating the CNN model on a large
dataset of plant leaf images.</p><hr>
